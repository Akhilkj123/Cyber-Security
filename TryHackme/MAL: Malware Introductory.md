## Task-2: Understanding Malware Campaigns

- Attacks are generally classified into 2 types

i)**Targeted** - This malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. 

ii)**Mass Campaign** -  The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.
## Task-3: Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:

- Delivery
- Execution
- Maintaining persistence 
- Propagation 

 **1. Delivery**-This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

**2. Execution**-Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important.

**3. Maintaining Persistence**

**4. Persistence**

In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:

**Host-Based Signatures**
-  These are two of many, many host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check against further infection.

**Network-Based Signatures**
- This classification of signatures are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation.

## Task-4: Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis
There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

**1. Static Analysis**
- It is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone.
- This method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.
- 

**2. Dynamic Analysis**
-  It is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. 
-  Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens. 

## Task-7: Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files

Navigate to the "Tasks" Folder on the Desktop, and then enter the "Task 7" Directory, where there will be three files:

- aws.exe

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/1c900aed-f37b-4e57-81dc-093e08e833ab)

- NetLog.exe

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/32ccb9b7-d0c4-4800-a67c-beb7f1faab11)

- vlc.exe

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/a2fac46e-98b4-41a7-ada6-f696a2c52c2c)


## Task-9: Identifying if the Executables are obfuscated / packed
- Now go into Desktop > Tools > Peid and analyse the file
a) What does PeID propose 1DE9176AD682FF.dll being packed with?

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/1443eb2e-cf41-4877-b913-2795435a5156)

b) What does PeID propose AD29AA1B.bin being packed with?

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/b7706dba-b5db-4a5e-8005-c102855e6ef1)

## Task 10:  What is Obfuscation / Packing?

a) What packer does PeID report file "6F431F46547DB2628" to be packed with?

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/a8963ca1-6de8-4077-9cff-8fd24eb07410)

## Task 12:  Introduction to Strings
- We use strings program to output the retained strings within the specified file

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/00f22f3f-59e4-4826-8164-f5468bf999c0)

a) What is the URL that is outputted after using "strings"

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/891c08fe-ccc9-40e1-9c66-14765459da6b)

Now we take the PE Explorer tool to analyse

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/3354700e-1e48-4863-a648-556d08afa6c2)

b) How many unique "Imports" are there?

- Now go the import parameter to view the number of imports
  
![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/e21a3d4f-9284-4e60-a953-aed986405f3a)

## Task 13:  Introduction to Imports

Now we use the IDA software to analyse the file

a) How many references are there to the library "msi" in the "Imports" tab of IDA Freeware for "install.exe"
- Now we analyse the msi file

  ![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/a59889ac-d2cd-4386-80e7-e4708196a5bb)
