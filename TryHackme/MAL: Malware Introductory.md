## Task-2: Understanding Malware Campaigns

- Attacks are generally classified into 2 types

i)**Targeted** - This malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. 

ii)**Mass Campaign** -  The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.
## Task-3: Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:

- Delivery
- Execution
- Maintaining persistence 
- Propagation 

 **1. Delivery**-This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

**2. Execution**-Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important.

**3. Maintaining Persistence**

**4. Persistence**

In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:

**Host-Based Signatures**
-  These are two of many, many host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check against further infection.

**Network-Based Signatures**
- This classification of signatures are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation.

## Task-4: Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis
There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

**1. Static Analysis**
- It is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone.
- This method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.
- 

**2. Dynamic Analysis**
-  It is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. 
-  Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens.
