## Task-2: What is Sigma?
- Sigma is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. This allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts.

### Sigma Use Cases
- To make detection methods and signatures shareable alongside IOCs and Yara rules.
- To write SIEM searches that avoid vendor lock-in.
- To share signatures with threat intelligence communities.
- To write custom detection rules for malicious behaviour based on specific conditions.
