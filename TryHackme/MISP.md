## Task 1:Room Overview
### MISP - MALWARE INFORMATION SHARING PLATFORM
- Its core objective to foster sharing of structured threat information among security analysts, malware researchers and IT professionals.

## Task 2: MISP Introduction: Features & Terminologies
- It is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates the collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud or any intelligence within a community of trusted members.

It is used for
- **Malware Reverse Engineering:** Sharing of malware indicators to understand how different malware families function.
- **Security Investigations:** Searching, validating and using indicators in investigating security breaches.
- **Intelligence Analysis:** Gathering information about adversary groups and their capabilities.
- **Law Enforcement:** Using Indicators to support forensic investigations.
- **Risk Analysis:** Researching new threats, their likelihood and occurrences.
- **Fraud Analysis:** Sharing of financial indicators to detect financial fraud.

MISP provides the following core functionalities:

- **IOC database:** This allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
- **Automatic Correlation:** Identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis.
- **Data Sharing:** This allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances.
- **Import & Export Features:** This allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
- **Event Graph:** Showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events.
- **API support:** Supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence.
