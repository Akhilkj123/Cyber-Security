## Task 2: Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/8e8c3b18-2e3a-4072-afa9-347611b93c9c)

- Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.
- The vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial.
- Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs.

  ### Some vulnerabilities which can be detected by both techniques
  - **Security Misconfigurations** - Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight.
  - **Broken Access Control** - This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.
  - **Insecure Deserialization** - This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application.
  - **Injection** - An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application.
 
a) You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner?
- yay

b) You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?
- injection

c) You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?
- Broken Access Control

## Task 3: Finding Manual Exploits
### Rapid 7
- Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database.
- The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).
- We can use exploit module in metasploit to abuse this vulnerability

### GitHub
- The site is used to host and share the source code of applications to allow a collaborative effort.
- Security researchers store & share PoC’s (Proof of Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.
- GitHub uses a tagging and keyword system, meaning that we can search GitHub by keywords such as “PoC”, “vulnerability”, and many more. 

### SearchSploit
- Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux.
- By giving the command 'searchsploit wordpress', we get

## Task 5: Practical: Manual Exploitation

- After entering into the AttackBox, we enter the machine ip in the browser

a) Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?

b) Now use the resources and skills from this module to find an exploit that will allow you to gain remote access to the vulnerable machine.
- Here we use searchsploit(offline version of Exploit-db) to use find the exploit

c) Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?
- Now we will use this exploit against the URL of the machine. For that we will copy the exploit python file to our machine

- Now we enter into the server of the application
