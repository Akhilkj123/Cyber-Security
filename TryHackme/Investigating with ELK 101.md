## Elastic stack
- collection of different open source components linked together to help users take the data from any source and in any format and perform a search, analyze and visualize the data at real-time.

### Elasticsearch 
- full-text search and analytics engine used to store JSON-formated documents. 
- important component used to store, analyze, perform correlation on the data, etc.

### Logstash
- data processing engine used to take the data from different sources, apply the filter on it or normalize it, and then send it to the destination.
- **input part** is where the user defines the source from which the data is being ingested. 
- **filter part** is where the user specifies the filter options to normalize the log ingested above.
- **output part** is where the user wants the filtered data to send.

### Kibana
- web-based data visualization that works with elasticsearch to analyze, investigate and visualize the data stream in real-time.
