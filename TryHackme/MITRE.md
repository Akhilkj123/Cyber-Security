## Task-1:  Introduction to MITRE

- ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
- D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

## Task-3:  ATT&CK® Framework

- MITRE began to address the need to record and document common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups used against enterprise Windows networks.
- Under initial access of ATT&CK Framework there are 9 techniques

- We can use the ATT&CK Matrix to map a threat group to their tactics and techniques.

a) Besides blue teamers, who else will use the ATT&CK Matrix? 
- red teamers

b) What is the ID for this technique?(Phishing)
- T1566

c) Based on this technique, what mitigation covers identifying social engineering techniques?



e) What groups have used spear-phishing in their campaigns? (format: group1,group2)
-Since the id's are given with a 'G' it is a group and 'S' represents a software

j) How many techniques are attributed to this group?
- Just counting the number of techiques used in Group Axiom gives the annswer as '15'.

## Task-4: CAR Knowledge Base

a) For the above analytic, what is the pseudocode a representation of?
- splunk search

b) What tactic has an ID of TA0003?
- Going to the scheduled task files and then each tasks will provide the anser.
