Answer the questions below

a) How many ports are open on the target system?
- First we conduct a search portscan

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/32926ee5-ec5b-41cc-a25f-5086ce386d28)

- Next we go to the auxiliary portscan location and run a scan to it which shows the open ports, so we get 5 ports.

b) Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?
- First we give a search netbios

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/ca6f0d68-3fc3-4d98-bdf8-3e97bdf8c19b)

- Then we add the RHOSTS to it and then go to the netbios/nbname group and then press run

c) What is running on port 8000?
- We entered search http_version

- We then added the RHOSTS and set the RPORT 8000 and run the file

d) What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.
- First we go to sbi_login file

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/19140099-c7f7-4506-9ed6-7d37565f5828)

- set DB_ALL_PASS true and we set USERPASSFILE_FILE 'file location'

a) Who wrote the module that allows us to check SMTP servers for open relay?
- First we login to the page of smtp relay



## Task - 5: Exploitation

a) Exploit one of the critical vulnerabilities on the target VM
-  A reverse payload will at least require you to set the LHOST option.

- Thus found a vulnerable file

b) What is the content of the flag.txt file?
- First we enter into the location of

c) What is the NTLM hash of the password of the user "pirate"?
- Now weperform hash du
