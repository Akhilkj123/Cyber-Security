## Task 2: Vulnerability Management vs Vulnerability Scanning
### Vulnerability Management
- It is an ongoing, proactive, and frequently automated activity that protects computer systems, networks, and enterprise solutions from cyberattacks and data breaches.
- vulnerability management is the process that encompasses vulnerability scanning, as well as other factors, including but not limited to risk acceptance, remediation, and reporting.
### Vulnerability Scanning
-  Utilising a computer program to find vulnerabilities in networks, computer infrastructure, or applications constitutes vulnerability scanning.

a) The process encompassing vulnerability scanning and other factors, such as risk acceptance, is called?
- vulnerability management

b) 
Is the overall objective of vulnerability management to increase an organisation's risk exposure?
- nay

## Task 3: Vulnerability Classification
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** - MITRE maintains the CVE list of publicly documented vulnerabilities and exposures. Each of the CVEs identifies a vulnerability that may be exploited to launch an attack.


## Task 4: Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Discover & Prioritise
a) After scanning, what is the total number of medium-level vulnerabilities?

## Task 5: Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Assess & Report

a) Download the LinuxAppTask report in PDF format. What is the severity rating of the vulnerability in the report, where the solution type is "Workaround"?


b) What is the solution type for the "TCP timestamps" vulnerability?
