**1. Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.**
- **Wi-Fi** is a wireless technology that enables devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other without the need for physical cables. It works by using radio waves to transmit and receive data between devices and a wireless access point (WAP) or wireless router.
   Some common types of attacks on Wi-Fi networks:
-  **Rogue Access Points:** Attackers can create rogue access points to trick users into connecting to them instead of the legitimate access point. Once connected, the attacker can intercept sensitive information such as login credentials or inject malware.
- **Password Cracking:** Attackers can use password cracking tools to guess or brute-force passwords to gain access to Wi-Fi networks.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** In a DoS attack, the attacker floods the Wi-Fi network with traffic to overload it, causing it to crash or become unavailable to legitimate users.
